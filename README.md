Vainglory Crappy Launcher

Vainglory Crappy Launcher - v1.1.0 - By starfoxcom

---------------NOTE-------------------------------------------

IF YOU ALREADY HAVE DOWNLOADED THE LATEST RELEASE, BEFORE OPENING THE LAUNCHER CREATE A FILE NAMED "version.txt",
THIS FILE IS USED TO SAVE THE RELEASE NUMBER EVERY TIME A NEW RELEASE IS FULLY DOWNLOADED, BUT IT CAN BE MODIFIED TO THE
USER'S PREFERENCE, CHANGE IT TO THE LATEST RELEASE ONLY IN THIS CASE.

---------------Recommendation---------------------------------

Extract the .zip file as it is, and leave it like that, everything that it's needed has to be on the same folder,
so just create a shortcut to the launcher (the launcher doesn't have icon, my bad).
	
---------------How it works-----------------------------------

Open the .exe file, the launcher will verify if a new release is up and will download it 
(maybe in the future this would not work, since it verifies it by looking into the website tags).

The launcher creates a file named "version.txt" which it's used to save and retrieve the local release number,
this is used to save the last release number of the installer downloaded and is used to compare with the release
number of the website.

The installer will be named as "VainglorySetup.exe" instead of the normal "VainglorySetup.[release].exe".
This is to avoid having a lot of installers every time a new release is up, since the launcher will replace
the old one with the new one. This file will be saved where the main launcher .exe file is.

The launcher can run the game as a normal launcher does, there's no need to set up the file path for this, 
and also the buttons shows different status (just like "Running", "Downloading update", "Installing").

The launcher has a "Install" button, which only works if the "VainglorySetup.exe" is found where the main launcher .exe file is,
so in case that you downloaded the game but didn't have time to install it.

For those who can't handle no visual feedback, the launcher has a progress bar.
